  //Be sure to return whatever gets returned from $http so you can call .then in your controller.

    //in your $http call (along with url and method) have a data property which has a value that is equal to another object which a key of text and a value of the message being passed to parse. IE data: {text: yourMessage} 
  //Also, remember that $http returns a promise. So if you return the whole $http call (return $http(...)), you can then use .then in your controller.
