angular.module('chatroom').controller('mainCtrl', function($scope, parseService){
  //In your controller you'll have a getParseData function and a postData function, but should be placed on $scope.

  //The getParseData function will call the getData method on the parseService object. You'll then save the result of that request to 
  //your controllers $scope as messages ($scope.messages)



  //The postData function will take whatever the user typed in (hint: look at the html and see what ng-model correlates to on the input box),
  //pass that text to the postData method on the parseService object which will then post it to the parse backend.




  //uncomment this code when your getParseData function is finished
  //This goes and gets new data every second, mimicking a chat room experience.
  // setInterval(function(){
  //   $scope.getParseData();
  // }, 1500)
